# SharpJoycon
A WIP cross-platform C# library for using the Nintendo Switch Joycons.

First project in C#, so it's likely crappy code.

# Requirements
* Bluetooth

This has only been tested on the latest Windows 10.

# Credits
* dekuNukem for his detailed documentation of the JoyCon's protocols
* mfosse for creating a working implementation
